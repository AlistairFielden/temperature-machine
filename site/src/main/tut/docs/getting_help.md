# Getting Help

## General Help and Discussions

For general discussions and help, head over to [temperature-machine on Gitter](https://gitter.im/temperature-machine/).

This should be your first port of call if you're not sure what's going on.


## Issues

If you think you've found a bug or would like to suggest a new feature, you can do so on Github via the project's [issue page](https://github.com/tobyweston/temperature-machine/issues).

Feel free to raise an issue or even better fork the code and have a go yourself.


## Twitter

Twitter is kind of terrible for support but you can reach out to me directly at [@jamanifin](https://twitter.com/jamanifin). If you like the project and want to help promote it, any tweets or posts would be much appreciated.
